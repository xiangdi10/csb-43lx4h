              Woody and the gang go on a road trip with new toy Forky, who's
              convinced he's trash and doesn't yet understand his role in the
              world. Along the way, Woody is unexpectedly reunited with
              independent spirit Bo Peep and finds himself faced with a
              decision, and a future, he never imagined.

                  He is a vintage cowboy doll that originally belonged to a boy
                  named Andy Davis. As Andy's favorite since kindergarten, Woody
                  served as the leader of Andy's toys, a position he upheld by
                  looking out for each member of the group. When Andy enters
                  adulthood and leaves for college, Woody is donated to a little
                  girl named Bonnie Anderson. He remains with Bonnie for some
                  time, before choosing to become an owner-less antique devoted
                  to helping lost toys find owners, alongside his girlfriend Bo
                  Peep.

                  He is a spaceman action figure originally belonging to Andy
                  Davis. Buzz was created during a time where astronauts were
                  especially popular amongst children. His arrival in the
                  original Toy Story created conflict with Andy's favorite toy
                  Sheriff Woody, though this rivalry would eventually blossom
                  into a lifelong friendship.

                  An actual spork-turned-craft-project, Forky is pretty sure
                  that he doesn’t belong in Bonnie's room. Unfortunately, every
                  time he tries to get away, Woody yanks him back into an
                  adventure he’d rather skip. Forky is a toy that Bonnie made
                  out of a disposable spork, so he’s facing a crisis. He wants
                  to fulfill his purpose as a spork, but now has a new toy
                  purpose thrust upon him.”

                  Bo is the romantic interest (later girlfriend) of Woody,
                  providing a calm and loving comfort whenever he is
                  overwhelmed. She is noted for using her shepherdess crook to
                  hook her cowboy and bring him closer in a romantic way. In
                  private, she is a great deal more daring with her words and
                  actions, which Woody seems to be quite fond of. She and her
                  sheep were bought along with the lamp not too long after Molly
                  was born, due to the baby being scared of the dark, which
                  "broke every toy's heart", according to Woody. The lamp
                  comforted Molly and she would often have her hand lay on Bo's
                  feet.
